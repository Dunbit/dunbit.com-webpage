## What is Technical Due Diligence?

If you work in an IT you have most probably experienced a Technical Due diligence check or assessment of your company. 

It is a process of evaluation of you company's:

* **- Technology**
* **- Technical personal and organization**
* **- Way of work, commitment and structure**
* **- Assesment of the risks, weaknesses of the technology and the team**

### When Technical Due Diligence happens?

This usually happens when:

* **- Company is being sold**
* **- Company got a new investing partner**
* **- Large contract/partnership is about to happen**
* **- Your Company is being merged into large company**

You as an `CTO or IT Architect` can find yourself either on examination side or your team/company is being examined. I will try to describe both aspects and what to do in both cases.

### How and Who to perform a Technical Due Diligence?

Mostly some senior IT member like `CTO` or `Senior Architect` is doing the Technical Due Diligence. Nothing is wrong with this selection but this is not always optimal. Especially if different people are used to do the evaluation. 

The main use case for Due Diligence nowadays is some VC investment. Especially for VCs I always suggest that the same person is doing evaluation, based on the company domain and technology he/she can always select additional help but it is important that all evaluations are baselined (easier to compare companies and investments).

Process:

1. Before performing official Due Diligence a lot can be checked as an outside observer (check companies released product, webpage, social media, linkedin, github, ...)
2. Overview interviews with CPO, CMO, VPs 2, can be done also remotely (I assume that CEO and CFO are also being interviewed by business)
3. Take few days to grasp what you have been told and build a picture, think about week points, prepare some interview questions upfront
4. On-site thorough overview of the architecture, technologies and processes in the company (requested upfront to be prepared by the company)
5. More detailed discussions about particular parts which are not clear and have some gaps
6. Deliver Final report to the Client


### How to prepare for a Technical Due Diligence?

No worries, you will just open your Document management system and browse through all Functional, Architecture and other specifications, read them and prepare for the _The Day_. In almost all cases this is not possible since existing specifications are outdated, some are missing. Updating the specification would need effort from all most of your technical team. What to do next?

Usually this leads to a critical team meeting and some `ad hoc overtime` work in order to prepare a minimum set of needed and requested documentation.
