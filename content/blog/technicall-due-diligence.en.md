## What is Technical Due Diligence?

If you work in an IT you have most likely been part of a Technical Due Diligence (a.k.a Technical Assessment).

Technical Due Diligence is a process of evaluation of your company:

* **- Technology**
* **- Technical personnel and organization**
* **- Way of work, commitment and structure**
* **- Assessment of the risks, weaknesses of the technology and the team**

### Why Technical Due Diligence?

Technical Due Diligence usually happens when:

* **- Company is being sold**
* **- Company is in a process of Series A, B, .. founding**
* **- Before signing large contract/partnership**
* **- Merger*

You as a `CTO or IT Architect` can find yourself either on examination side or your team/company is being examined. Each case has it's own characteristics and you need to play different roles. If you are on an examined side your role is to higher the value of the company in the eyes of investors while on an examination side your role is to find all the deal breakers and all the flaws which would lead to hidden costs after the investment or event to bad investment. 

### How and Who to perform a Technical Due Diligence?

Usualy VCs use some senior IT members like `CTO` or `Senior Architect` of their portfolio company is doing the Technical Due Diligence. Nothing is wrong with this selection, but this is not always optimal. Especially if this happen from time to time and this is not this is unformal and no proper Due Diligence process is defined. 

The main use case for Due Diligence nowadays is some VC investment. Especially for VCs I always suggest that the same person/team is doing evaluation. Additional experts based on the company domain and technology can be always added. But it is important that all evaluations are baselined (easier to compare companies and investments).


Process:

1. Discuss with a Client about what plans they have with a company. Focus can then be on different aspects (e.g. Quick time to market and scale user base from 10k to 10M is something completely different than just buy off certain technology and integrate it either by refactoring or new implementation in already existing solution/product)
2. Before performing official Due Diligence a lot can be checked as an outside observer (check companies released product, webpage, social media, Linkedin, Github, sometimes - B2B, it also make sense to visit one of the customers and discuss directly with him)
3. Signing of the NDA
4. Written documentation request
5. Overview interviews with CTO, CPO, CMO, VPs, which can be done also remotely (I assume that CEO and CFO are also being interviewed by the business, if not can be also included). If company is smaller and above organization is not established, discussion with some senior staff is needed
6. Take a few days to grasp what you have been told, read the documents and specifications and build your own picture, think about week points, prepare some interview questions upfront
7. On-site thorough overview of the architecture, technologies and processes in the company (requested upfront to be prepared by the company)
   1. Architecture, Technology and Infrastructure (source code can also be checked, sometimes just some random repository to get a filling about organization, structure andquality of the code)
   2. Personal
   3. Company Processes and Organization
   4. IP and Software Licenses (also open source software)
   5. Roadmap and Future plans, Past Roadmaps and realization of them
   6. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)s
8. More detailed discussions about particular parts which are not clear and have some gaps, detail review of part might include also source code check
9. Deliver Final report to the Client
