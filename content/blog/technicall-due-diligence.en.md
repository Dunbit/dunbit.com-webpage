## What is Technical Due Diligence?

If you work in an IT you have most likely been part of a Technical Due Diligence (a.k.a Technical Assessment).

It is a process of evaluation of your company:

* **- Technology**
* **- Technical personnel and organization**
* **- Way of work, commitment and structure**
* **- Assessment of the risks, weaknesses of the technology and the team**

### Why Technical Due Diligence?

This usually happens when:

* **- Company is being sold**
* **- Company got a new investing partner**
* **- Large contract/partnership is about to happen**
* **- Your Company is being merged into the large company**

You as a `CTO or IT Architect` can find yourself either on examination side or your team/company is being examined. I will try to describe both aspects and what to do in both cases.

### How and Who to perform a Technical Due Diligence?

Mostly some senior IT member like `CTO` or `Senior Architect` is doing the Technical Due Diligence. Nothing is wrong with this selection, but this is not always optimal. Especially if different people are used to do evaluations. 

The main use case for Due Diligence nowadays is some VC investment. Especially for VCs I always suggest that the same person is doing evaluation, based on the company domain and technology he/she can always select additional help but it is important that all evaluations are baselined (easier to compare companies and investments).



Process:

1. Discuss with a Client about what plans they have with a company since then you can be more careful on certain aspects (e.g. Quick time to market and scale user base from 10k to 10M is something completely different than just buy off certain technology and integrate it either by refactoring or new implementation in already existing solution/product)
2. Before performing official Due Diligence a lot can be checked as an outside observer (check companies released product, webpage, social media, Linkedin, Github, sometimes - B2B, it also make sense to visit one of the customers and discuss directly with him)
3. Written documentation request
3. Overview interviews with CTO, CPO, CMO, VPs, can be done also remotely (I assume that CEO and CFO are also being interviewed by the business, if not can be also included). If company is smaller and above organization is not established, discussion with some senior staff is needed
4. Take a few days to grasp what you have been told, read the documents and specification and build your own picture, think about week points, prepare some interview questions upfront
5. On-site thorough overview of the architecture, technologies and processes in the company (requested upfront to be prepared by the company)
   1. Architecture, Technology and Infrastructure
   2. Personal
   3. Company Processes and Organization
   4. IP and Software Licenses (also open source software)
   5. Roadmap and Future plans, Past Roadmaps and realization of them
   6. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
6. More detailed discussions about particular parts which are not clear and have some gaps
7. Deliver Final report to the Client
